__app_description = """
API-design for a maze solving system. Mazes may only have one exit; reaching the exit is defined as "reaching the last line in the maze".

Mazes may be solved with "minimum" steps and Mazes may be solved with "maximum" steps.
 
- Used this to test the basis from the fastapi-demo-app ( https://github.com/vroomfondel/vendingmachine )
- Used this to try out https://web.deta.sh/ as a simple demo-runtime-platform.
- Used this to bang my head against the wall about a proper/tuned (non-recursive) DFS-longest-path implementation

Tried to adhere:
- GET	A GET method (or GET request) is used to retrieve a representation of a resource. It should be used SOLELY for retrieving data and should not alter.
- PUT	A PUT method (or PUT request) is used to update a resource. For instance, if you know that a blog post resides at http://www.example.com/blogs/123, you can update this specific post
- by using the PUT method to put a new resource representation of the post.
- POST	A POST method (or POST request) is used to create a resource. For instance, when you want to add a new blog post but have no idea
- where to store it, you can use the POST method to post it to a URL and let the server decide the URL.
- PATCH	A PATCH method (or PATCH request) is used to modify a resource. It contains the changes to the resource, instead of the complete resource.
- DELETE	A DELETE method (or DELETE request) is used to delete a resource identified by a URI.
